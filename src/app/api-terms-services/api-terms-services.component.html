              or, if disclosed orally, is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and is subsequently reduced
              to a writing marked "Confidential" and delivered to the other party within ten (10) days of disclosure, or

              other than as required to perform under this Agreement. Where Confidential Information is required to be disclosed
              by a court, government agency, regulatory requirement, or similar disclosure requirement, you shall immediately
              notify BluWallet upon learning of the existence or likely existence of such requirement and shall use reasonable
              efforts to avoid such disclosure and, if necessary, use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment
              or protection by order of any disclosed Confidential Information. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in
              Section 15 ("Notice"), notification to BluWallet under this Section 7.2 should be provided by personal delivery

              BluWallet users don’t make transaction requests to us instead, they transact themselves, directly with a virtual currency
              network.
            </p>
            <p>Check out our open-source code on GitHub.</p>

            <p>BluWallet’s wallet is essentially a backup service, like Dropbox or Amazon Cloud, except much more limited.</p>
            <p>We can only back up one kind of file – an encrypted wallet.</p>

            <p>BluWallet is not a financial intermediary. This is different than how virtual currency exchanges operate. We
              never know any of our users’ private keys.</p>
            <p>
              We don’t take control of or transmit our users’ virtual currency. BluWallet is noncustodial. BluWallet users can store and
              spend the same virtual currencies, in as many other industry-standard software wallets as they like... at the
              same time as they are stored in a BluWallet wallet.
            </p>
            <h4>BluWallet can’t:</h4>
            <p>
              Spend virtual currency on a user’s behalf (or against the user’s wishes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Freeze or forfeit virtual currency on law enforcement’s behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              Determine the balance of wallets.
            </p>
            <h4>BluWallet does not know its users’:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Wallet balances</li>
              <li>Verified legal names</li>

              <li>Users send & receive virtual currency using the wallet software as they please</li>

                (e.g. 19Y5NSiG5kk5wWjMD17euEaQ5PErpwxWkp).</li>
