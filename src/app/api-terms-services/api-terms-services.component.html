              in advance). Specific Prohibitions: Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, you are
              specifically

            <p>4. Certification. Your use of the Coinways Content and participation in the API Program may be dependent

              Content in accordance with this Agreement ("Certification"). You shall be responsible for all costs
              associated
              with Certification and any modification necessary to meet the Certification criteria. Future modifications
              of your Site, use or display of the Coinways Content or API Program are subject to re-Certification.
              Failure
              by you to obtain and maintain Certification is cause for immediate termination of this Agreement.</p>

              5. Display of Coinways Content. You may only display the Coinways Content in accordance with the
              following guidelines:

              information
              in a Public Display; provided however, You may provide specific Coinways User information to the
              Coinways
              User for Private Display for such Coinways User. "Public Display" is defined as the display of the
              Coinways
              Content to anyone other than the owner, originator, creator, or developer of such content. "Private
              Display"
              is defined as the display of the Coinways Content to a particular Coinways User relating only to such
              Coinways
              User's Coinways activities;

            <p>4. Certification. Your use of the Coinways Content and participation in the API Program may be dependent
              upon
              the certification by Coinways or an independent third party designated by Coinways of your technology in

              Coinways
              Content in accordance with this Agreement ("Certification"). You shall be responsible for all costs
              associated
              with Certification and any modification necessary to meet the Certification criteria. Future modifications
              of your Site, use or display of the Coinways Content or API Program are subject to re-Certification.
              Failure
              by you to obtain and maintain Certification is cause for immediate termination of this Agreement.</p>

              Content to anyone other than the owner, originator, creator, or developer of such content. "Private
              Display"

              as any confidential or proprietary information which is disclosed to you in a writing marked
              "Confidential"
              or, if disclosed orally, is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and is subsequently

              the API Program, your User ID, and Customer Information (including user IDs, passwords, and any account
              information)

              purpose
              other than as required to perform under this Agreement. Where Confidential Information is required to be

              treatment
              or protection by order of any disclosed Confidential Information. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
              in
              Section 15 ("Notice"), notification to Coinways under this Section 7.2 should be provided by personal
              delivery

              Coinways users don’t make transaction requests to us instead, they transact themselves, directly with a
              virtual currency
              network.
            </p>
            <p>Check out our open-source code on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Coinways's wallet is essentially a backup service, like Dropbox or Amazon Cloud, except much more
              limited.</p>
            <p>We can only back up one kind of file – an encrypted wallet.</p>

            <p>Coinways is not a financial intermediary. This is different than how virtual currency exchanges operate.

              spend the same virtual currencies, in as many other industry-standard software wallets as they like... at
              the
              same time as they are stored in a Coinways wallet.

              Spend virtual currency on a user’s behalf (or against the user’s wishes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Freeze or forfeit virtual currency on law enforcement’s behalf.

            <p>
              Determine the balance of wallets.
