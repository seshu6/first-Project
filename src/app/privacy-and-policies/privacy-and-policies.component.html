                  <h1>5. THE WALLET</h1>
                  <p>5.1. Description</p>
                  <p>5.1.1 The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by BluWallet New Zealand S.A. At no point will
                    BluWallet
                    ever take custody or control over Virtual Currency stored in your Wallet. The Wallet is only capable
                    of supporting certain Virtual Currencies. Under no circumstances should you attempt to store Virtual
                    Currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support. The Wallet does not store, send, or
                    receive
                    Virtual Currency.</p>
                  <p>5.1.2 When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public
                    key pair
                    that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual
                    Currency
                    network. You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Wallet,
                    private
                    key or transaction information that you maintain in your Wallet or otherwise with the Services. If
                    you
                    do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will be may not be able to
                    access Virtual Currency previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no
                    longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to Virtual Currency. We are
                    not
                    responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf.</p>

                  <p>5.2 Risk Disclosures Relating to the Wallet.</p>
                  <p>5.2.1 In order to be completed, any Virtual Currency transaction created with the Wallet must be
                    confirmed
                    and recorded in the Virtual Currency ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network.
                    Such
                    networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which are
                    not
                    owned, controlled or operated by BluWallet.</p>
                  <p>5.2.2 BluWallet has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not
                    ensure
                    that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the relevant Virtual
                    Currency
                    network. You agree and understand that the transaction details you submit via our Services may not
                    be
                    completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process the
                    transaction.
                    We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in any Virtual Currency or make any
                    warranties
                    whatsoever with regard to title.</p>
                  <p>5.2.3 Once transaction details have been submitted to a Virtual Currency network, we cannot assist
                    you
                    to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. BluWallet has no control over
                    any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or
                    modification
                    requests.
                  </p>
                  <p>5.3 Forks. In the event of a Fork, BluWallet may not be able to support activity related to your
                    Virtual
                    Currency. You agree and understand that, in the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be
                    completed,
                    completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. BluWallet is not responsible
                    for
                    any loss incurred by you in caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork.</p>
                  <p>5.4 No Password Retrieval.</p>
                  <p>5.4.1 With respect to the Wallet, BluWallet does not receive or store your Wallet password, nor any
                    keys,
                    network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet password retrieval. You
                    are
                    solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your Wallet password. Any Virtual
                    Currency
                    you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do not know or keep secret your
                    Wallet
                    password. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including, without
                    limitation,
                    a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of virtual currency in your wallet.
                  </p>
                  <p>5.4.2 When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any
                    other
                    website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep
                    secret
                    all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e) promptly
                    notify
                    us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use
                    the
                    backup functionality provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup files. You agree to take
                    responsibility
                    for all activities that occur under your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or
                    unauthorized
                    access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
                  <p>5.5 Fees. BluWallet does not currently charge a fee for Wallet, receiving, sending or controlling
                    Virtual
                    Currency. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case any applicable fees
                    will be displayed prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation
                    “miner’s
                    fees”) required to use a Virtual Currency network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to
                    calculate
                    such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may select a
                    greater
                    or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for paying any such fee and BluWallet will neither advance
                    nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee
                    calculation.</p>

                    in

                    connection with your purchase of a Lockbox from such third party. We may, from time-to-time, include

                    support

                  <p>8.2.1 No Purchase Necessary. There is no purchase necessary to receive Virtual Currency in an
                    Airdrop.

                    the Airdrop Program, we reserve the right to do so in the future and shall provide notice to you in
                    such
                    case.

                    limited

                    Program
                    due to change in your contact information that was not updated by you prior to such time as the

                    was delivered by us to you.</p>

                    private
                    keys. You agree and understand that BluWallet will not be responsible for any communication

                    disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however
                    caused.</p>
                  <p>9.2 You accept and acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilizing any virtual currency
                    network,
                    including, but not limited to, the risk of unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to

                    network

                    limited

                    fraudulent actions.
                  </p>
                  <p>9.3 The risk of loss in using Services involving Virtual Currencies may be substantial and losses
                    may occur
                    over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to significant
                    fluctuations
                    that may be unpredictable.
                  </p>
                  <p>9.4 Virtual Currencies are not legal tender and are not backed by any sovereign government. In
                    addition,
                    the legislative and regulatory landscape around Virtual Currencies is constantly changing and may

                    intellectual

                  </p>
                  <p>11.2.1 Technical Support. We will use commercially-reasonable efforts to supply email-based
                    technical support
                    services, but cannot guarantee immediate responses, especially during times of high volume.</p>
                  <p>11.2.2 Disputes. You agree and understand that any dispute arising under this User Agreement shall
                    be settled
                    in binding arbitration, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules.</p>
                  <p>11.2.2.1 Arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall
                    take
                    place in the county in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English
                    language.
                    The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including
                    attorneys'
                    fees when authorized by law, and the arbitration decision may be enforced in any court. You agree
                    that
                    the arbitrator shall have the authority to order relief, and you agree to abide by all decisions and
                    awards rendered in such a proceeding, which shall be final and conclusive. At your request, hearings
                    may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and
                    determining
                    motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to
                    enforce
                    this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.
                  </p>
                  <p>11.2.2.2 If the arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes filing fees or other administrative costs on
                    you,
                    we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you
                    would
                    otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. If a court decides that any
                    provision
                    of this section concerning Arbitration is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed
                    and
                    resolved in accordance with New Zealand law exclusively and the other parts of this section
                    concerning
                    Arbitration shall still apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If
                    the invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court instead of
                    arbitration,
                    the Parties agree that such court must be located in New Zealand, applying New Zealand law.

                    waive your right to a trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit.

                    <h4>Login Information:</h4>
                    <p>We log technical information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser and
                      version
                      you use, last access time of your wallet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to create the
                      wallet
                      and the most recent IP address used to access the wallet.</p>
                    <h4>Device Information:</h4>
                    <p>We collect information about the device you use to access your account, including the hardware
                      model,

                      not tied to any particular person.</p>
                    <h4>Wallet Information:</h4>
                    <p>If you create a BluWallet wallet through our Services, you may choose to generate a public and
                      private
                      key pair. When you log out of the wallet, we collect an encrypted file, that, if unencrypted,
                      would
                      contain these keys, along with your transaction history. When you enable notifications through

                      Account Settings, we will collect the unencrypted public key in order to provide such
                      notifications.
                      Under no circumstances do we ever collect an unencrypted private key from you, nor can we decrypt

                      collect

                      Virtual
                      Currency to another (e.g. Bitcoin for Ether).</p>
                    <h4>Information We Collect from Other Sources:</h4>
